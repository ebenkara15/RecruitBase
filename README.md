# RecruitBase

A Django template app for managing recruitment platform.

**Work in progress - More description to come**

This project is mainly inspired from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv_bwpA_aEA&list=PL-51WBLyFTg2vW-_6XBoUpE7vpmoR3ztO) from https://github.com/divanov11


## How to use it

Start by completing the file [settings.py](https://github.com/ebenkara15/RecruitBase/blob/main/src/CVProfiler/CVProfiler/settings.py) with your settings especially with your mail address for user activation. You can also set the mail backend to the console.

Then create a superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser` and start using it.
